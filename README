This is a repository that extends FST to classes that can be used as a basis for building
VST compatible FST plugins. This repo contains a compatibility wrapper for plugins written
for VST2 SDK and a modified version of VST GUI 3.6 SDK that can be used for creating FST
plugins with GUI.

My purpose of creating this repository was to create a free compatibility wrapper for my own
VST2 compatible plugins. Hence, the supported feature set may be limited if some features have
not been needed in my own plugins.
